# Changelog for `futr2`

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0.1 - 2024-03-08 - Publishing inherited codebase

**State of the union:** The relay is mostly functional. There
is a ruthless bug somewhere within the SQL packages, which
is causing stack overflow errors with an undetermined cause.
The relay continues operating, but not at 100% reliability.

The front-end client is full of potential, but much of this
potential will require consolidated effort to realize. Docs
are non-existent, the variables are poorly named, and there
is no effort towards creating a readable codebase.

Code needs a thorough cleaning. Progress will continue.
